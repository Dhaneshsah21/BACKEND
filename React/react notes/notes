Class Component vs Functional Component:
A class component in React is created using an ES6 class that extends React.
Component and includes a render() method to return JSX, while a functional component is a simple 
JavaScript function that returns JSX.
Earlier, class components were required for state management and lifecycle methods, but with the 
introduction of Hooks, functional components can now handle state and side effects, making them 
more concise, easier to read, and the preferred choice in modern React development.

Lifecycle Methods in Class Components:
Lifecycle methods allow developers to run code at specific stages of a component’s life cycle. 
componentDidMount() is used after the component is rendered for tasks like API calls or 
subscriptions, componentDidUpdate() is triggered after updates to props or state and is useful for 
responding to changes, and componentWillUnmount() is used for cleanup operations such as removing 
event listeners or canceling timers. These methods help manage side effects in class components.

setState and Its Asynchronous Nature:
The setState() method is used in class components to update the component’s state and trigger a 
re-render. It works asynchronously because React batches multiple state updates together to improve 
performance and ensure efficient rendering, rather than updating the DOM immediately for every 
state change.

PureComponent vs Regular Component:
A PureComponent is a special type of class component that performs a shallow comparison of props 
and state using shouldComponentUpdate(). This prevents unnecessary re-renders when the data has not 
changed, improving performance. In contrast, a regular class component re-renders every time state 
or props change unless manually optimized.

Error Boundaries in React:
Error boundaries are special class components used to catch JavaScript errors in their child 
component tree and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the app. They are implemented using 
static getDerivedStateFromError() and componentDidCatch(). Error boundaries still require class 
components because React currently does not provide a Hook-based alternative for handling rendering 
errors.
