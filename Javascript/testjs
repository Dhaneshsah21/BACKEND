1. Why let and const were introduced when var already existed?
`var` has function scope, allows redeclaration, and causes hoisting-related bugs.
`let` and `const` provide block scope, prevent redeclaration, and make code more
predictable and safer. `const` also prevents reassignment.


2. How does JavaScript decide the data type of a variable at runtime?
JavaScript is dynamically typed, so the data type is determined by the value
assigned at runtime, not during variable declaration.


3. Difference between == and ===, and why companies prefer ===?
`==` compares values after type conversion, which can lead to unexpected results.
`===` compares both value and type strictly, so companies prefer it to avoid bugs.


4. How do logical operators (&&, ||) help write cleaner code?
Logical operators use short-circuit evaluation, reducing unnecessary condition
checks and minimizing long if-else blocks, making code cleaner and readable.


5. When would you choose switch over if-else?
`switch` is preferred when checking a single variable against multiple fixed
values, improving readability and maintainability over long if-else chains.


6. Why does do-while loop execute at least once?
Because the condition is checked after executing the loop body, ensuring the
code runs at least one time.


7. What happens internally when a for loop runs?
A for loop runs in this order: initialization → condition check → code execution
→ increment/decrement, repeating until the condition becomes false.


8. How does array indexing work, and what if index doesn't exist?
Arrays are zero-indexed. Accessing a non-existing index returns `undefined`
instead of throwing an error.


9. Difference between map() and forEach()?
`map()` returns a new transformed array and is used for data transformation.
`forEach()` does not return anything and is used for executing logic.


10. Why are higher-order array methods preferred?
They improve readability, reduce boilerplate code, support immutability, and
are commonly used in modern JavaScript and React applications.

11. How is an object stored compared to a primitive?
Primitive values are stored directly in stack memory, while objects are stored
in heap memory and accessed using references.


12. Difference between for...in and Object.keys()?
`for...in` iterates over enumerable properties including inherited ones.
`Object.keys()` returns only the object's own properties, making it safer.


13. Parameters vs arguments and callbacks?
Parameters are variables in function definitions.
Arguments are actual values passed to functions.
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments for async or reusable logic.


14. Why does asynchronous JavaScript not block the main thread?
Async JavaScript uses the event loop, Web APIs, and callback queue to handle
time-consuming tasks in the background, keeping the UI responsive.


15. Role of V8 engine in JavaScript and React?
V8 compiles JavaScript into optimized machine code, manages memory efficiently,
and enables fast execution, which is essential for high-performance React apps.
