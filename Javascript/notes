1. map()
map() always returns a new array. It is used to transform data
and the new array will always have the same length as the
original array. It does not modify the original array and is a
non-mutating, chainable method. The callback function receives
the current element, index, and the original array. It executes
for every element even if the condition fails. It is commonly
used for formatting data, updating object properties, and
preparing data for UI rendering.

2. reduce()
reduce() returns a single value from an array. It combines all
elements into one value such as a number, string, object, or
array, depending on the logic. It processes elements from left
to right and usually uses an initial value. The callback 
function receives the accumulator and current value on each 
iteration. It is useful for calculating totals, grouping data, 
counting occurrences, and flattening arrays. If no initial 
value is provided, the first element is used as the accumulator.

3. forEach()
forEach() is a higher-order function because it takes a 
function as an argument. It is used only for iteration and 
always returns undefined. It cannot be chained and does not 
support break, continue, or return. It executes the callback 
for every element in the array. It is mainly used for logging 
values, updating external variables, or performing side 
effects. It can modify the original array if elements are 
changed directly inside the callback.

4. find()
find() is best used for searching condition-based data. It 
returns the first element that matches the condition and stops 
execution once a match is found. If no element matches, it 
returns undefined and does not modify the original array. It is 
more efficient than filter() when only one match is required. 
It works well with arrays of objects and returns the actual 
element, not the index.

5. filter()
filter() returns a new array containing all elements that 
satisfy a condition. The length of the new array may be smaller 
than the original array. It is a non-mutating method and is 
useful when multiple matching results are required. The 
callback function must return a boolean value. It executes for 
every element in the array. It is commonly used for removing 
unwanted data, validating lists, and creating subsets of data.
